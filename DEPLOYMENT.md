# How to Deploy to GitHub Pages (Manual Method)

Since `git` command line tools are not available on this machine, the easiest way to publish your app is to upload the files directly to GitHub.com.

## Step 1: Create a Repository
1. Log in to your GitHub account (`waelpg@gmail.com`).
2. Click the **+** icon in the top-right corner and select **New repository**.
3. Name it something like `finance-app`.
4. Make sure it is **Public**.
5. Click **Create repository**.

## Step 2: Upload Files
1. On the new repository page, look for the link that says **uploading an existing file**.
2. Drag and drop **ALL** the files and folders from your project folder (`untigravity 1`) into the browser window.
   - Make sure to include `index.html`, `manifest.json`, `css/`, `js/`, and `icons/` (if created).
3. Wait for the files to upload.
4. In the "Commit changes" box at the bottom, type "Initial commit".
5. Click **Commit changes**.

## Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages
1. In your repository, go to the **Settings** tab (top right).
2. On the left sidebar, click **Pages** (under the "Code and automation" section).
3. Under **Build and deployment** > **Branch**, select `main` (or `master`) from the dropdown.
4. Ensure the folder is set to `/ (root)`.
5. Click **Save**.

## Step 4: Get Your App Link
1. Wait about 1-2 minutes.
2. Refresh the **Pages** settings page.
3. You will see a bar at the top saying: "Your site is live at..." followed by a link (e.g., `https://waelpg.github.io/finance-app/`).
4. Open this link on your iPhone to install it!

## Step 5: Install on iPhone
1. Open the link in **Safari**.
2. Tap the **Share** icon (square with arrow up).
3. Scroll down and tap **Add to Home Screen**.
4. Tap **Add**.
